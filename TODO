= TO-DO List
# TODO    VIVADO  - Synthesize modules OOC.
# TODO    VIVADO  - Export project mode script.
# TODO    QUESTA  - change compile list to a `find . -iname ...` command.
# TODO    VIVADO  - research non-project mode tcl scripting.

== Low Priority List
# TODO    QUESTA  - VOPT.

= COMPLETED
# DONE    VIVADO  - Research non-project mode scripts.
# REJECT  VIVADO  - 'make update_ip'. REASON: Too many manual steps needed to automate the update.
# DONE    VIVADO  - make xci tcl script configure the right device/board/family
# DONE    VIVADO  - Make a `lib_core`, or similar.
# DONE    VIVADO  - Super basic constraints file.
# DONE    VIVADO  - Create TCL scripts in lieu of both the BD and XCIs.
# DONE    VIVADO  - Make a simple top level project that validly creates a bitstream in the GUI.
# DONE    VIVADO  - install vivado.
# REJECT  QUESTA  - Fix modelsim.ini target compilation edge cases. REASON: Hard to re-create, Makefiles are inherently 'unsafe'.
# REJECT  QUESTA  - Make dependencies more than just '_info'. REASON: make targets don't really support multiple '%' patterns in one target.
# DONE    QUESTA  - Makefile speed test (and regression test).
# DONE    GENERAL - Split the make templates from the example design.
# DONE    GENERAL - Makefile Time reporting.
# DONE    GENERAL - Top level Makefile.
# DONE    GENERAL - Licensing.
# DONE    QUESTA  - regressions - Compiling results and rejecting empty REGRESSION_LISTS.
# DONE    QUESTA  - regressions - running all TCs.
# DONE    QUESTA  - Multiple TCs.
# DONE    GENERAL - Start of Top level readme.
# REJECT  QUESTA  - if block.mk has 'include ../lib_<dep>/<dep>.mk', but not '$(BLOCK)_DEPENDENCY := lib_<dep>'. REASON: Too interdependent, just list both.
# DONE    QUESTA  - CLEAN UP VSIM OPTIONS, etc.
# DONE    QUESTA  - FIX OSVVM ... LOL.
# DONE    QUESTA  - MIXED HDL LIBRARIES.
# DONE    QUESTA  - VSIM :)
# REJECT  QUESTA  - Fix what happens if subdir has hdl change. REASON: couldn't recreate bug. :)
# DONE    QUESTA  - Remove the LOCAL_COMP funny business / clean up compilation.
# DONE    QUESTA  - Fix the questa_block COMPILE_ORDER DECLARATION.
# DONE    QUESTA  - Make the clean recursive.
# DONE    QUESTA  - Make the questa compilation recursive.
# DONE    QUESTA  - set -e / fix verbosity.
# DONE    QUESTA  - Test what happens on VCOM/VLOG Error.
